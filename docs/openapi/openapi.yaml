      ## Overview
      
      Fast, accurate postal address validation. The Address Autocomplete API provides real-time address suggestions as users type, eliminating typos and mistakes and reducing the time it takes to find accurate postal addresses. If you are looking for a general places or location search, see our Address Autocomplete API Documentation. If you need any help integrating our Address Autocomplete API into your website or application, get in touch and one of our product experts will help get you started.
      
      ## Data Coverage
      
      The following countries are available in the Address Autocomplete API:
      
      - ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom
          
      
      ## Authentication
      
      Each request must be authenticated with a Address Autocomplete API key, which you can create in your Swiftcomplete account:
      
      1. [Sign in](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/login/) if you're already registered, or [create a Swiftcomplete account](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/register) if you're new to the service.
          
      2. Go to the [API section](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/api) and create a **Address Autocomplete API Key**.
          
      
      ## Integration Options
      
      Once you've created a Address Autocomplete API Key, you can build a server-side integration using the API.
      
      ## API Integration
      
      Integrate the Swiftcomplete Address Autocomplete API for general location and place search functionality.

      description: |
        This endpoint provides flexible and intelligent search capabilities for addresses, what3words locations, postcodes, and places. 
        By leveraging the `searchFor` parameter, you can tailor the search to specific types of location data, enabling real-time autocomplete and lookup functionality for a wide range of use cases, from address validation to location-based services.
