It is designed to be integrated into your address capture flow, for example on e-commerce checkout pages. Swiftcomplete is uniquely designed to return a valid address as fast as possible.\n\n## Why use Swiftcomplete?\n\nImproves quality of address data\n\n- If addresses aren’t checked and validated then there is no guarantee they can be used successfully for deliveries or geolocating.\n    \n- Poor addresses = missed or failed deliveries, costing businesses money and creating poor customer experience.\n    \n\n## Easy to set up and run\n\n- Credit packs from £10 (3p per address) (Bespoke enterprise solutions available)\n    \n- Plugins available for BigCommerce and [WooCommerce](https://swiftcomplete.notion.site/Swiftcomplete-WooCommerce-address-autocomplete-1a466db17f3b8018bc4ce65f85f6c852)\n    \n- Documentation for API set-up: click [here](https://swiftcomplete.notion.site/Swiftcomplete-Integration-Docs-1a466db17f3b80a18a63dced29d4cfb5?pvs=4)\n    \n\n## Simplify your user experience\n\n- Address validation makes address-entry quicker, easier and less error-prone.\n    \n- Swiftcomplete UI is specifically designed to match a customer with their deliverable address as quickly as possible\n    \n\n## Key Features\n\n- Fast: Operates with low latency\n    \n- Comprehensive: Combines high quality geospatial databases and multi-residence addresses for best possible address matching.\n    \n- Easy to use: Simple, effective user interface\n    \n- Cost-effective: Credit packs from £10 (3p per address) (Bespoke enterprise solutions available)\n    \n- what3words entry: included as standard\n    \n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/92d056d3-a788-410c-9b03-1bca744379c4/aW1hZ2UucG5n\" alt=\"Example%20of%20Swiftcomplete%20Address%20Validation%20Flows\" width=\"1918\" height=\"994\">",

			"description": "## Overview\n\nFast, accurate postal address validation. The Address Autocomplete API provides real-time address suggestions as users type, eliminating typos and mistakes and reducing the time it takes to find accurate postal addresses. If you are looking for a general places or location search, see our Address Autocomplete API Documentation. If you need any help integrating our Address Autocomplete API into your website or application, get in touch and one of our product experts will help get you started.\n\n## Data Coverage\n\nThe following countries are available in the Address Autocomplete API:\n\n- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom\n    \n\n## Authentication\n\nEach request must be authenticated with a Address Autocomplete API key, which you can create in your Swiftcomplete account:\n\n1. [Sign in](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/login/) if you're already registered, or [create a Swiftcomplete account](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/register) if you're new to the service.\n    \n2. Go to the [API section](https://www.swiftcomplete.com/account/api) and create a **Address Autocomplete API Key**.\n    \n\n## Integration Options\n\nOnce you've created a Address Autocomplete API Key, you can build a server-side integration using the API.\n\n## API Integration\n\nIntegrate the Swiftcomplete Address Autocomplete API for general location and place search functionality.\n\n### API Request Example\n\n```\nGET https://api.swiftcomplete.com/v1/places/?key=INSERT_KEY_HERE&text=Nottingham&countries=gb\n\n ```\n\n### API Parameters\n\n| Parameter Name | Value | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| biasTowards | coordinates, what3words | Number, String | The API will prioritise results near your approximate location (determined by your IP address) if this parameter is not provided. Either a what3words location (only if what3words has been enabled on this API key, in the format \"///word1.word2.word3\") or a WGS84 coordinate (in the format \"latitude,longitude\") |\n| container | V1;65 | ALFRED Road | LONDON |\n| countries | 'ca,us' | String | Comma-separated list of ISO 316601 alpha-2 country codes to restrict search within.If the parameter is not provided the API will search for all the available countries. |\n| distanceUnits | ‘metric’ or ‘imperial’ | String | Unit of measurement for distance displaymetric → Return distance in kilometres, unless under 1km in which case metres are returnedimperial → Return distance in miles, unless under 0.1 miles in which case feet are returned |\n| key | null | String | API key for Swiftcomplete Address Autocomplete. |\n| maxDistance | 3000 | Number | A distance in km to limit the search radius from the biasTowards coordinate. |\n| maxResults | 5 ( for address records)  <br>3 (for what3words records) | Number | Maximum number of results to display.Note If the results are more than maxResults=100 than pageFrom parameter needs to be used to loop the results per 100 records. |\n| populateIndex | \\-1 | Number | Index for populating the autocomplete field.Used to obtain detailed information about a result in the response array. For example, to obtain full information for the first record, pass populatedIndex=0, or for the second, pass populatedIndex=1 and so on.The usual flow is to obtain a list of suggestions by making an API request without populatedIndex specified, and then allow the user to select a result in the list by passing populatedIndex in a second request.For integrations where a user isn't present to select a result (e.g. data cleansing or batch processing), simply pass populatedIndex=0 to automatically obtain detailed information about the most relevant result in the list. |\n| populateLineCount | 5 | Number | Number of lines to populate in the autocomplete field. |\n| searchFor | 'what3words, address, place, road, transit' | String | A comma-separated list of result types to filter results. Types are hierarchical, so providing \"transit\" includes everything in the transit category, \"transit.airport\" only returns airports and \"transit.airport.large\" only returns the largest airports. |\n| text | w25eu or 65 alfred rd or filled.count.soap or London | String | A full or partial search term such as a postcode, street, city or what3words. |\n| groupResults | true | Boolean | Used when nothing is being typed on the search field, Only when the query is empty. |\n| pageFrom | 1 | Number | Indicates the starting page for results. |\n\nUse the hierarchical types to filter results to only include exactly what you're looking for.\n\nFor example, pass \"place.area.country,transit\" to only search for country names and public transport.\n\nThe API will search for all data types if searchFor is not provided.\n\n### Available `searchFor` Types\n\n| Level | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **First level** |  |  |\n|  | what3words | All what3words addresses |\n|  | address | All traditional addresses |\n|  | place | Postcodes and all types of settlements (cities, towns, villages, counties, provinces, etc.) |\n|  | road | All types of roads |\n|  | transit | All types of public transport |\n| **Second level** |  |  |\n|  | place.area | Postcodes and counties, states, etc. |\n|  | place.settlement | Cities, towns, villages, etc. |\n|  | transit.airport | Airports |\n|  | transit.metro | Metro and London Underground stops |\n|  | transit.railway | Railway stations |\n|  | transit.tram | Tram stops |\n| **Third level** |  |  |\n|  | place.area.county | Counties |\n|  | place.area.postcode | Postcodes, ZIP codes, etc. |\n|  | place.area.country | Countries |\n|  | place.area.state | States |\n|  | place.area.province | Provinces |\n|  |
